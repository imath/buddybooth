BuddyBooth
==========

BuddyBooth is a BuddyPress 1.7 plugin i made out of my tutorial about encouraging a user to add an avatar image to his profile.

It uses HTML5 and with the getUserMedia() javascript function if the browser supports it, else it will use an Adobe Flash method.

You can find the tutorial [here](http://imathi.eu/2012/11/18/buddypress-avatar-management/). This tutorial came with a BuddyPress child theme that included a photobooth feature i've called BuddyBooth. This child theme (BP Mystery Man Hunt) is also available on [github](https://github.com/imath/bp-mystery-man-hunt).

A few minutes ago, Greg McEwan-Marriott added a comment on this tutorial saying :
> is it possible to run buddybooth as a separate plugin, would really love feature

So i built this standalone plugin ;)

Once the plugin activated, members of the community will be able to take a snapshot of themselves from their "change avatar" profile area and simply use it as their avatar.

You can watch a demo of BuddyBooth on my vimeo [vimeo](http://vimeo.com/imath/buddybooth)

Available in french and english.
